# LoRa_sx1280_Transmitter

## Overview

The `LoRa_sx1280_Transmitter` project demonstrates the use of the SX1280 transceiver for wireless communication via LoRa technology. The project focuses on transmitting data, offering a foundation for building long-range, low-power communication systems.

## Features

- LoRa data transmission using the SX1280 module
- Simple C implementation
- Can be expanded for various IoT applications
- The whole library is written myself on the base of Semtech sx1280 Datasheet, despite of sx1280.cpp and sx1280.h are included in the project. I do not use them.
  
## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AleksPopova-rwth/LoRa_sx1280_Transmitter.git
